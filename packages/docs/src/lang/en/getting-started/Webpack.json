  "existingHeader": "## Existing applications",
  "existingAlert": "If your existing application is using Vue CLI 3, please use the [above guide](#new-applications) on how to install the Vuetify package.",
  "existingText1": "To include Vuetify into an existing project, you must install its _npm package_. You can use either `npm` or `yarn` to accomplish this task. These are both package managers that allow you to control what resources are available in your application.",
  "existingText2": "For a detailed explanation of how to get `npm` running in your environment, check out the [official npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm). Alternatively, if you wish to use yarn, you can find more information on the [official yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/). Once setup, you can run either command from the cli.",
  "existingText3": "Once Vuetify has been installed, create a folder within you `src` directory called `plugins`. Inside, add a **vuetify.js** file. This is where we will handle all of our bootstrapping and setup of Vuetify for your project.",
  "existingHeader3a": "### vuetify-loader installation",
  "existingText3a": "There are three ways in which you can install Vuetify. The first (and recommended) way is to utilize the [vuetify-loader](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader) or what we call automatic **A-la-carte**. This will ensure that your application only uses the features and styles from Vuetify that are needed, significantly reducing your application's compiled size. Keep in mind, when importing from `vuetify/lib`, the necessary styles are _automatically_ imported for you.",
  "existingText3a1": "If there is a reason you are unable to utilize the **Vue CLI 3** package, you can manually install the **vuetify-loader** through your **vue.config.js** or **webpack** config. For more information on manual installation, navigate to the [A-la-carte page](/customization/a-la-carte).",
  "existingHeader3b": "### A-la-carte installation",
  "existingText3b": "You can also manually import individual components without the need for the **vuetify-loader**. This is considered manual **A-la-carte**.",
  "existingHeader3c": "### Full installation",
  "existingText3c": "The last method will import and setup **all** of Vuetify's features and styles. As stated above, it is still **recommended** that you utilize the **vuetify-loader** if at all possible. For this install, you will need to _manually_ import the Vuetify styles. This is also the process used when bootstrapping Vuetify through a browser as opposed to compiling. You can observe the browser installation in our [cdn quickstart](https://codepen.io/johnjleider/pen/bgJOrX).",
  "webpackHeader1": "### Webpack installation",
  "webpackText1": "When using webpack, you have the ability to setup your application with either of the above options (**Full** or **A-la-carte install**). However, you will need to configure add a webpack rule (or modify an existing one) for sass files. You can start by installing the necessary dependencies:",
  "webpackText2": "Once installed, locate your `webpack.config.js` file and copy the snippet below into the **rules** array. If you have an existing **sass** rule configured, you may need to apply some or all of the changes below. If you are you looking to utilize the **vuetify-loader** as well, you can find more information on setting it up with webpack on the [A-la-carte](/customization/a-la-carte#vueconfigjs-installation) page.",
  "existingHeader4": "## Bootstrapping the Vuetify Object",
  "existingText4": "Once you have setup your initial Vuetify options in your `src/plugins/vuetify.js` file, you must then pass that object into your main Vue instance options. This install process is similar to **vue-router** and **vuex**",
  "existingHeader5": "## Font Installation",
  "existingText5": "Vuetify uses the Google Roboto font per the [Material Design Specification](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html). The easiest way to use this font is by add a `<link>` element in the `<head>` of your main `index.html`.",
  "existingText6": "You can also asynchronously load the fonts by using the [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader).",
  "existingHeader7": "### MDI Iconfont",
  "existingText7": "Vuetify uses [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) as its default iconfont. The simplest way to install it is through `npm`.",
  "existingText8": "Once the package is installed, simply import it into the `vuetify.js` file in your plugins folder.",
  "existingText9": "For more information on different support iconfonts and advanced implementations, navigate to the [Icons](/customization/icons) page."
